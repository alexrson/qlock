SHIFT REGISTER

  Use a shift register to turn three pins into eight (or more!)
  outputs

  An integrated circuit ("IC"), or "chip", is a self-contained
  circuit built into a small plastic package. (If you look closely
  at your Arduino board you'll see a number of ICs.) There are
  thousands of different types of ICs available that you can use
  to perform many useful functions.

  The 74HC595 shift register in your kit is an IC that has eight
  digital outputs. To use these outputs, we'll use a new interface
  called SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). It's like the TX and 
  RX you're used to, but has an additional "clock" line that 
  controls the speed of the data transfer. Many parts use SPI
  for communications, so the Arduino offers simple commands called
  shiftIn() and shiftOut() to access these parts.

  This IC lets you use three digital pins on your Arduino to
  control eight digital outputs on the chip. And if you need 
  even more outputs, you can daisy-chain multiple shift registers
  together, allowing an almost unlimited number of outputs from 
  the same three Arduino pins! 

Hardware connections:

  Shift register:
  
    Plug in the chip so it bridges the center "canyon"
    on the breadboard.
    
    The shift register has 16 pins. They are numbered
    counterclockwise starting at the pin 1 mark (notch
    in the end of the chip). See the datasheet above
    for a diagram.

    74HC595 pin		LED pin		Arduino pin
    
    1  (QB)		LED 2 +
    2  (QC)		LED 3 +
    3  (QD)		LED 4 +
    4  (QE)		LED 5 +
    5  (QF)		LED 6 +
    6  (QG)		LED 7 +
    7  (QH)		LED 8 +
    8  (GND)				GND
    
    9  (QH*)
    10 (SRCLR*)				5V
    11 (SRCLK)				Digital 3
    12 (RCLK)				Digital 4
    13 (OE*)				GND
    14 (SER)				Digital 2
    15 (QA)		LED 1 +
    16 (VCC)				5V
  
  LEDs:
  
    After making the above connections to the positive (longer)
    legs of the LEDs, connect the negative side (short lead) of
    each LED to a 330 Ohm resistor, and connect the other side
    of each resistor to GND.
